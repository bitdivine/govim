Vim for google drive

* Open [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/my-drive)
* Click "New"
* Don't see Vim?  Go down to *More*.  Click *Connect more apps*.  Seach for Vim.
* Still found nothing?  That's the problem I want to fix.

Fund me and I will build it.  The source code will be freely available here, in this repository.
